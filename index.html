                skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                 and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also 
                 educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative 
                 effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called 
                 pedagogy. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
                 primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions,
                 education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular
                  for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,
                   which promotes quality education for all.</p>
